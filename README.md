This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

// TODO:IN PROGRESS:

- handle language and theme there
- fix search explore, about app modal, add to list, lists list, youtube modal in landscape
- store user data in firestore "name, mail, pic, token, notification token"

// HIGH PRIORITY:

- use redux persist for offline support
- fix ios voice search "delete search then clicking mic restores the search key - problem with voice start and end'
- fix collapsed button
